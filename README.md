## Overview

Our company wants in on the fun of creating original video content like all the big companies aroung them. Because of this, the company has decided they want to start producing movies.  
The problem is, they have never done this.  They are not sure where to start and they don't want to lose money on this.

## Business Understanding

We wanted to gather box office performance and trends to gain insight into our decision making.

We were provided raw data sets from several sources stemming from budget, gross revenue, film length, genres, and popularity.
We wanted to focus around return on investment based on production budgets, genre, and production companies..

We finalized it down to three datasets:  Movie Data, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers.
You can find these inside the data folder inside this repository.

We used these three datasets to come to conclusions on how best to approach this new business adventure.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

We started by individually opening, cleaning and exploring each data set.  They do vary in cleaning methods, size, ect. So, for a further look into the coding itself, feel free to read the jupyter notebook titles Movie_Data_Notebook.ipynb.

Below are a few of the EDAs we came up with during our analysis. Again please refer to the notebook for a closer look into these EDAs.

First is a box plot of our runtime outliers from our Movie Data source.

## Our Findings

We took notice of the timing of films being released. We saw that the summertime and holiday seasons grossed the most, which also coincided with the films that had the highest budgets. Kids are out of school and the Oscars are around the corner. We suggest releasing movies during the summer and holiday season seem to be the most profitable times of the year.

We found the most common types of movies were drama, comedy, action, thriller, crime, and so on. Our objective was to make sure that we maximize our profits by seeing what had the best ROI. After analyzing the data, we saw that the top film genres with the highest ROI were horror, thriller, and drama.  While Sci-fi, comedy, and animation show to have a higher budget, they do not necessarily have the best ROI.
Cast, marketing, costumes, travel, location, etc. could all play a factor in the budget. Spending too much money and not receiving a profit could be detrimental but, a smaller budget film could produce high reward and lead to more success.

Our last idea was to take notice of the most profitable studio already in play. We think a collaboration with DreamWorks (PDW) would also be a safe course of exploration into the movie industry. A new film production studio can have starting costs anywhere from $10,000 for a small studio to over $1 million dollars for the larger studios.
DreamWorks is well-known for animations, but the studio also produces horror films such as, The Haunting, The Ruins and many more. Since they have a high profit average, the company can use this collaboration to familiarize themselves with the industry. Not only what is required to start and run a studio, but also a better understanding of how to be successful in the business.

## Conclusion

We would want the company to consider horror, thriller, and drama genres. We also recommend considering partnering up or consulting with successfully experienced production companies. The Summer and holiday seasons seem to be the best time to release movies. And lastly, we would want to make sure we are wise with our investment and be strategic in how we spend money. A low budget has potentially the highest reward with minimal negative impact.
